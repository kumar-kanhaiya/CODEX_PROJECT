🚀 About Codex

Codex is an EdTech platform built to fix the actual problems students face every day:
scattered notes, confusing roadmaps, coding frustration, and distraction overload.

The goal is simple — give students clarity, focus, and fast help when they’re stuck.

Codex provides:

📘 Structured academic notes

🧭 Step-by-step roadmaps

🎧 Distraction-proof lecture experience

🤖 A coding-only chatbot (Gemini API) that blocks irrelevant questions

💻 Hand-picked coding playlists & resources

📱 Fully responsive UI for all devices

🧠 Why This Exists

Students don’t struggle due to lack of talent — they struggle because:

Bad resources waste time

Unclear learning paths cause confusion

Coding help is inconsistent

Distractions kill focus

Codex attacks all of these with a clean, fast, easy-to-follow platform.
